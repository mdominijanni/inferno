class DifferenceMonitor(Monitor):
    """Records the difference of an attribute in a Module before and after its forward call.

    Args:
        reducer (Reducer): underlying means for reducing samples over time
            and storing them.
        attr (str): attribute or nested attribute to target.
        module (Module, optional): module to register as the target for monitoring,
            can be modified after construction. Defaults to None.
        train_update (bool, optional): if this monitor should be called when the module
            being monitored is in train mode. Defaults to True.
        eval_update (bool, optional): if this monitor should be called when the module
            being monitored is in eval mode. Defaults to True.
        prepend (bool, optional): if this monitor should be called before other
            registered forward prehooks or posthooks. Defaults to False.
        filter_ (Callable[[Any, Any], bool] | None, optional): test if the input should
            be passed to the reducer, ignores None pre or post values when None.
            Defaults to None.
        map_ (Callable[[Any, Any], torch.Tensor] | None, optional): modifies the input
            before being passed to the reduer, post minus pre if None.
            Defaults to None.

    Note:
        The nested attribute should be specified with dot notation. For instance,
        if the observed module has an attribute ``a`` which in turn has an
        attribute ``b`` that should be monitored, then ``attr`` should be
        `'a.b'``. Even with nested attributes, the monitor's hook will be tied to
        the module with which it is registered.

    Note:
        The left-hand argument of ``filter_`` and ``map_`` is the attribute after
        the :py:meth:`~torch.nn.Module.forward` of ``module`` is run, and the right-hand
        argument is before it is run.

        By default, ``filter_`` will only reject an input if both the pre and post
        states are ``None``. By default, ``map_`` will subtract the pre-forward value
        from the post-forward value. If either is ``None``, it will assume the ``None``
        value was composed of all-zeros.
