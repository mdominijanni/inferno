    Here, ``prev_data`` and ``next_data`` should be the nearest two observations,

    from which to sample. ``step_time`` is the total length of time between the
    observations ``prev_data`` and ``next_data``.

    The result is a single tensor, shaped like ``prev_data`` and ``next_data``,
    containing the interpolated data.

    The result is a 2-tuple of tensors, both shaped like ``data``, the first being the
    the extrapolated data at the time of the nearest prior discrete observation and the
    second being the extrapolated data at the time of the nearest subsequent discrete
    observations.

        sample (torch.Tensor): sample from which to extrapolate.
        sample_at (torch.Tensor): relative time of the data from which to extrapolate.

class DimensionReduction(Protocol):

    For simpler cases, these will wrap PyTorch methods such as :py:func:`torch.mean` for
    convenience. When the ``kwargs`` are defined with a partial function, these should
    be compatible with parameters in Inferno such as ``batch_reduction`` and should be
    compatible with ``einops.reduce``. To this end, any implementation should maintain
    the default behavior for ``keepdim``.

    Args:
        data (torch.Tensor): tensor to which operations should be applied.
        dim (tuple[int, ...] | int | None, optional): dimension(s) along which the
            reduction should be applied, all dimensions when ``None``.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        keepdim (bool, optional): if the dimensions should be retained in the output.
